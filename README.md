## RecipesFullStack 🍳

### Overview
RecipesFullStack is a full-stack web application for managing recipes. It includes a front-end using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Tailwind CSS, and a back-end likely involving Node.js and Express.js.

### Important Notes!!! 🚨
**Images**: I encountered some issues with the images, some of them corrupted partly and some completely, USE ON OWN RISK. I'm NOT responsible for any damage done to the images.
**Usage on own risk** 🚫

**AI Generated**: I generally used Unsplashed for the Images, but sometimes if no image was found, I resorted to AI generated Images.
This also means the recipe themselves do **NOT** identically look like the images. 🖼️
