## RecipesFullStack

### Overview
RecipesFullStack is a full-stack web application for managing recipes. It includes a front-end using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Tailwind CSS, and a back-end likely involving Node.js and Express.js.

### Important Notes!!!
**BE CAREFUL WITH IMAGES**: I encountered some issues with the images, some of them corrupted partly and some completely, USE ON OWN RISK. I'm NOT responsible for any damage done to the images.
**USE AT OWN RISK**

**SOME IMAGES ARE AI GENERATED**: I generally used Unsplashed for the Images, but sometimes if no image was found, I resorted of AI generated Images.
This also means the recipe themselves do **NOT** identically look like the images.

**THIS IS NOT COMMERCIAL USAGE**: This is just for my portfolio and showcase my skill. You can further build it with logging system, but change the images.
